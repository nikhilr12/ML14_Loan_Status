# ML14_Loan_Status
As the name suggests, the purpose of our project is to create and implement a machine learning algorithm that can predict whether or not a person will get a loan based on various factors like gender, salary, education, etc. 
TO accomplish this, we first implemented a logical regression model in python. With this model, we got a variable accuracy ranging from 75% to 85%. This wasnt high enough and it was too variable.
We also implemented different types of Naive Bayes methods like Gaussian, multinomial and bernoulli. The accuracy went up to 87-88%. This was still not high enough.
This is why we decided to shift to a deep learning algorithm. We implemented ANN. After playing around a bit with the number of hidden layers, epochs, and activation functions, we managed to get our accuracy up to 97% to 98%. 
The dataset we used was small and had many limitations, but despite that, we managed to achieve what we did.
This project was created by Electrical engineering FY students of IIT Indore Safdar Inamdar, Nikhil Raizada and Ashutosh Nayak for submission to IITISOC 2021.
